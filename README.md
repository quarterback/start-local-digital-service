# Roll Your Own Digital Service (RYODS)

## About This Project

RYODS is an opinionated, modular guide to building minimum viable digital service teams in government based on hard-earned lessons from the field. This isn't a comprehensive manual, but rather a collection of tactical frameworks and proven approaches for navigating the unique challenges of creating effective digital capabilities in the public sector.

## Why This Guide Exists

After spending years in government digital transformation, I've observed both successful and failed attempts to establish digital services. The difference between success and stagnation often has little to do with technology choices or budget size, but instead hinges on organizational structure, talent strategy, political positioning, and project selection.

Most existing resources focus on procurement reform or technical modernization rather than the foundational elements that determine whether a digital service will actually solve real problems for real people. RYODS aims to fill this gap.

## What You'll Find Here

This guide will cover essential topics including:

- Organizational positioning that balances independence with influence
- Team composition that prioritizes problem-solving over specific technical skills
- Project selection frameworks that identify high-leverage opportunities
- Strategies for building political capital without compromising user focus
- Practical approaches to user research in resource-constrained environments
- Methods for measuring and communicating impact beyond cost savings
- Tactics for navigating risk-averse bureaucracies while fostering innovation

## Who This Is For

This guide is designed for:
- Local government leaders considering establishing digital capabilities
- Existing digital teams looking to increase their effectiveness and impact
- Civic technologists transitioning from volunteer to professional government work
- Public servants tasked with modernizing service delivery

## How To Use This Guide

RYODS is intentionally modular. Each section stands alone and addresses specific challenges you might face when establishing or growing a digital service. Start with the sections most relevant to your current situation rather than trying to implement everything at once.

The guide includes practical tools, templates, and decision frameworks you can adapt to your specific context. It's meant to be a living resource that evolves based on real-world feedback and emerging best practices.

## Contributing

While this guide represents my personal perspective based on direct experience, I welcome feedback, questions, and suggestions. The most valuable insights often come from those currently doing the work of building digital services in diverse contexts.
