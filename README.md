# Roll Your Own Digital Service (RYODS)

## About This Project

RYODS is an opinionated, modular guide of my thoughts on what should happen in a digital services vision of the future. 

What do we mean by *digital services* is subjective, but as the guide is written, it'll be more clear that we're generally talking about public-serving digital transformation.
