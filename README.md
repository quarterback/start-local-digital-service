# Introduction
The proliferation of digital services agencies sprouting around the world pioneered by the UK's Government Digital Service, have slowly trickled to the state and local levels. This repo aims to list the various efforts (specifically in the US, but feel free to add others) and eventually, to compile articles and information that might help entities make the case for _why_ they're doing it. 

It's also worth noting that Code for America brigades partner with local governments, and community patners. They engage citizens to do this type of work, and is always worth exploring if one does not exist in your community -- or partner with an existing one -- but I'm not including them on this list. Just government sponsored digital entities.
